# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-C

This repository contains the material required for the understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms in C language. In my repository, I have made a single file for a single topic which will contain all the necessary functions and the main function and print function telling you how to pass arguments to it and access values from one function to another giving detailed knowledge of call by value and call by reference.
